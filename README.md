#Front-End

Proposal

What problem does your app solve? -- It allows users to save and organize articles for later;

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? -- When a researcher finds an article of interest, she can 'pin' it to their profile for later browsing.

What is the mission statement? -- To house all your information in a single accessible location. Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product? -- Have to be able to see cards and add cards

What features may you wish to put in a future release? -- Ability to drag a url from browser and directly pin it to board. -- TBD

What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users? -- I think the most similar is pinterest; allows users to browse interesting items and buy related stuff

?
What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using? -- Axios -- React Router DOM -- Design library? TBD

Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access? -- TBD

Are you required to pay to use the API? -- NA

Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?) For Data Scientists -- NA

Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.
You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app -- LOL
Target Audience

Who is your target audience? Be specific. -- Researchers interested in saving work
What feedback have you gotten from potential users? -- None yet
Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How? -- No, we selected this from a list of projects
Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday. Prototype Key Feature(s) -- OK... ?

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
